# AHB-FIR-Filter
An AMBA AHB-Lite 4-point FIR filter in SystemVerilog with programmable 16-bit coefficients, streamable sample input, and status/error reporting.

## Overview

This design integrates an **AHB-Lite subordinate** (slave) with a 4-point FIR filter core. Software writes four 16-bit coefficients over AHB, streams 16-bit input samples into a register, and reads the 16-bit filtered output. The subordinate supports 8-bit and 16-bit accesses, reports invalid accesses via `HRESP`, and exposes status (idle/busy/error).

## Operation

This figure captures the flow of an FIR filter operation. Each new input sample enters at x[n] and is passed through a series of unit delays (represented by (z^{-1}) ), shifting the signal to the right by one time step at each stage. Each delayed sample is multiplied by a corresponding coefficient (b_{i}), and the resulting products are summed to produce the output y[n]. 

This operation follows the discrete convolution equation represented by:

*From [Wikipedia - Finite Impulse Response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response)*

This design is a 4-point FIR Filter, represented by this equation: 

$$\ y[n] = [
 (s_1 \cdot f_0) + (s_2 \cdot f_1) + (s_3 \cdot f_2) + (s_4 \cdot f_3)
\]$$

where:
- y[n] is the output each cycle
- $$s_x$$ are the four most-recent samples (e.g., $$\(s_1=x[n]\)$$, $$\(s_2=x[n-1]\)$$, $$\(s_3=x[n-2]\)$$, $$\(s_4=x[n-3]\))$$
- $$f_x$$ are the corresponding filter coefficients

Equivalent standard convolution form:

$$
y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{3} h[k]\cdot x[n-k]
\text{ where } h[k] == f_k \text{ and } x[n-k] == s_{k+1}
$$

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| AHB-Lite Subordinate | Standard `HSEL/HADDR/HTRANS/HSIZE/HWRITE/HWDATA/HRDATA/HRESP` interface. No wait states (always ready). |
| 4-Point FIR | 16-bit unsigned samples √ó four 16-bit fixed point programmable coefficients. |
| Coefficient Loader | Write four coefficient registers then **arm** via a control register; loader copies them into the datapath and auto-clears the arm bit. |
| Sample Streaming | Write a sample to the **New Sample** register; the core latches, shifts the 4-deep sample window, and computes the output. |
| Output Register | Read the 16-bit unsigned filtered result from the **Result** register. |
| Status & Errors | Status shows IDLE/BUSY/ERROR. Arithmetic overflow is detected and reflected in Status; invalid addresses/sizes assert `HRESP=1`. |
| 8/16-bit Access | Supports byte or half-word transfers (`HSIZE=000` or `001`); registers are even-aligned. |

## What I Did
- Designed and implemented RTL in SystemVerilog for: `ahb_subordinate.sv`, `fir_filter.sv`, `coefficient_loader.sv`, `controller.sv`, `counter/flex_counter.sv`, `magnitude.sv`, `sync.sv`, and the top wrapper `ahb_fir_filter.sv`.
  *(Bus model BFM (`ahb_model.sv`) and `datapath.sv` provided as a simulation helper.)*
- Authored SystemVerilog testbenches (`tb_ahb_fir_filter.sv`) to verify configuration, coefficient loading, streaming, and error cases.
- Produced block/FSM diagrams to document the subordinate, loader, and controller behavior.

## Design Notes & Assumptions
- Samples and FIR output are 16 bit unsigned int values (0‚Ä¶65,535). Coefficents are UQ1.15 fixed point values ([0,2.0)). Additionally, the datapath MUL computes ( $$S_x \cdot ùëì_x ) ‚â´ 15 $$ and returns a 16-bit unsigned result.
- Overflow Error results from ALU operation exceeding 16 bit limit (0‚Ä¶65,535). Status Reg will be become `0xd256`, indicating an error.
- Reading or writing to an invalid address with raise `HRESP`.
- FIR Filter Sync are only needed when inputs are asynchronous and are not used with AHB-Lite interface.
- FIR Filter has configurable High Pass Filter operation represented by $$y[n] = [(s_1 \cdot f_0) - (s_2 \cdot f_1) + (s_3 \cdot f_2) - (s_4 \cdot f_3)]$$. This can be accessed by setting parameter `HIGH_PASS_FILTER == 1`. Default is `HIGH_PASS_FILTER == 0`.

## Verification

**Loading Coefficients**

<img width="1000" height="430" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46fbef5e-1200-4858-b420-39e719ff2e98" />

 1) Program Coefficient Values: Write values `1, 1.25, 1.5, 2` to `haddr` `0x6`, `0x8`, `0xA`, `0xC` (coefficients `F0..F3`). [Coeff Calc](https://chummersone.github.io/qformat.html)

2) Verify writes: Read back `haddr` `0x6`, `0x8`, `0xA`, `0xC` to confirm coefficient values.

3) Initiates Coefficient Loading: Write `1` to `haddr` `0xE` (New Coefficient Set Confirmation register) to request a load.

4) Loader handoff: The Coefficient Loader samples `0xE = 1` and commands the FIR to latch the pending coefficients.

5) Sequential load (busy): The FIR Filter loads `F0 ‚Üí F3` one-by-one; `modwait` is asserted while the load is in progress.

6) Completion check: During loading, read of `haddr` `0xE` (and/or Status) to monitor progress. After Coefficient Loader begins loading, `0xE` auto-clears to `0`, confirming the new coefficients are set.

**Streaming Samples**

Streaming Sample Values: `{16'd00100, 16'd00200, 16'd00150, 16'd00101, 16'd04000, 16'd00900, 16'd00400, 16'd00001}`.

Expected Values:

*From [Rapid Tables](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/math/convolution-calculator.html)*

Result Reg Values: `{16'd00100, 16'd00325, 16'd00550, 16'd00787, 16'd04750, 16'd06350, 16'd07726, 16'd09850, 16'd02400, 16'd00800, 16'd00001}`

1) Stream Samples: Each sample is written into the New Sample Reg (`0x4`) when Status Reg (`0x0`) is IDLE (`0`).
2) Compute:  The FIR grabs the new sample, asserts BUSY, performs the MAC over the 4-deep history, and produces new Result (`0x2`).
3) Read and Continue: When Status returns to IDLE, read Result Reg (`0x2`) and write the next sample.
